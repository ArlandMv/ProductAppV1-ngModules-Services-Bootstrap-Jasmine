Detailed Purpose Analysis (from a Product Manager's Perspective):

As a product manager, ProductsManagerApp serves as a fundamental tool for organizing and managing a product catalog or inventory. Its purpose is to provide a structured way to store, access, and modify information about the products that a business sells or maintains. It is a base application that can be expanded with other functionalities.

Core Purposes:
1. Centralized Product Information: The application serves as a central repository for all product-related information. This includes details such as product names, descriptions, pricing, and any other attributes that are relevant to the business.
2. Data Consistency: By storing all product information in one place, the application helps maintain data consistency across the organization. This ensures that everyone is working with the same, accurate information about products.
3. Product Lifecycle Management: The application supports the entire product lifecycle by allowing new products to be added (created), existing products to be modified (updated), and obsolete products to be removed (deleted).
4. Reporting and Analysis: The structured data within the application makes it easier to generate reports about products, such as sales data, inventory levels, or product performance metrics.
5. Scalability: Although the current implementation is basic, the foundation provides a scalable solution for the management of more products and functionalities.

Target Users:
1. Internal Teams: Sales, marketing, and customer support teams would use the application to get information about the products.
2. Business Owners: Managers and owners can use it to oversee inventory and analyze product performance.
3. Administrators: Staff responsible for maintaining the product catalog, adding new products, or removing old ones.

Potential Enhancements:
1. Categories and Tagging: Add the ability to categorize and tag products for easier filtering and searching.
2. Inventory Tracking: Implement a system for tracking the quantity of each product in stock.
3. Image Management: Allow product images to be uploaded, stored, and displayed.
4. User Roles and Permissions: Define different user roles with varying levels of access.
5. Sales Data: Add fields to products to gather sales data.
6. Search Functionality: Allow users to search for products.
